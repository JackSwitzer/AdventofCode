Advent of Code 2024
Every day a new language - let's try to get some points

Languages: Python, Java, R, php,  C, C++, Rust


Next: Lean, Haksell, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, Assembley, Bend, CUDA?,  .......

Pivoting slightly to get some points, Rust focus with utils and quick compile based on Sonnet. Will still try to get 10+ languages.
